<h1>Front End NE Talk</h1>
</header>


<p>Back in August 2019, I did my first ever talk at FrontEnd NE. I talked about the process I went through 
when designing and developing the website. This included the personas I created for the stakeholders to 
determine what content should go on the website and then on to the technical requirements - such as 
considering if a cms was required.</p>

<p>This talk was to by far the biggest audience I had ever spoken to, and was scary at first. I don't 
remember much about the talk itself, but I think it was well received based on the kind comments I received afterwards.</p>

<p>Thanks to FrontEnd NE for having me.</p>
