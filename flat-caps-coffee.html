Flat Caps Coffee Shop is located on Carliol Square, Newcastle. 

Decorated with exposed girders and brickwork, bare wood and plants hanging from the ceiling, 
this large, bright and airy space provides a place for which one could meet friends for a catch up, 
have somewhere to work with a coffee, or as a place to chill.
