                <p>I'm Stuart I build stuff for the web and am passionate about accessilibty and user experience while working as a .NET software developer. I live in the north east of England with my wife and two kids.</p>
                <p>Here I will talk about my work, other things that interest me.</p>
                <p>I have also realised that <a href="blog/20191028-why.htm">I am stressed out and in need of change</a>, so have started to make changes to simplify my life by embracing the principles of minimalism and essentialism.</p>
                <p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/trubru">@trubru</a>.</p>
